        2. Assassination Classroom<br>
        Assassination Classroom is very cool anime.<br>
        The series follows the daily life of an extremely powerful octopus-like being working as a junior high homeroom teacher,<br>
        and his students dedicated to the task of assassinating him to prevent Earth from being destroyed.<br>
        The students are considered “misfits” in their school and are taught in a separate building; the class he teaches is called 3-E.<br>

        3. Classroom of the Elite<br>
        Classroom of the Elite is cool anime. In the distant future, the Japanese government has established the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School,<br>
        dedicated to instruct and foster the generation of people that will support the country in the future. <br>
        The students are given a high degree of freedom in order to closely mimic real life.<br>
        The story follows the perspective of Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a quiet and unassuming boy who is not good at making friends and would rather keep his distance,<br>
        but possesses unrivaled intelligence.<br>
        He is a student of D-class, which is where the school dumps its inferior students.<br>
        After meeting Suzune Horikita and Kikyō Kushida, two other students in his class, Kiyotaka's situation begins to change and he starts to get involved in many affairs,<br>
        and his thought of ideal normal highschool life begins to get scattered.<br>

        4. Seven Deadly Sins<br>
        The Seven Deadly Sins are the strongest and cruelest order of Holy Knights in the Kingdom of Liones.<br>
        They were formed by seven brutal criminals, who had all been convicted for grievous crimes and had carved the symbols of seven beasts onto their bodies.<br>
        After having been framed for murdering the Great Holy Knight, they were indefinitely disbanded, as well as branded as traitors and villains.<br>
        They are the main protagonists of the series.<br>
