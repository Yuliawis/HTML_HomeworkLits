            Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan.<br>
            In Japan and in Japanese, anime describes all animated works,<br>
            regardless of style or origin.However, outside of Japan and in English,<br>
            anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to<br>
            animation produced in Japan.Animation produced outside of Japan with<br>
            similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.<br>
            The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917.A characteristic<br>
            art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka<br>
            and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.<br>
            Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly<br>
            to home media, and over the Internet.In addition to original works, anime<br>
            are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.<br>
            It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.<br>
            Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in<br>
            response to emergent technologies.It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography,<br>
            and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.Compared to Western animation,<br>
            anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and<br>
            use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.Diverse art styles are used,<br>
            and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature<br>
            being large and emotive eyes. The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies,<br>
            including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, <br>
            the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming.<br>
            As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.<br>
